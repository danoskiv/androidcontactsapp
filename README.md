# androidcontactsapp
Android application for collecting contacts info, which uses web-api

This repo contains 2 folders, one of which is the Android project, and the other one is the Web API, which I worked on while I was in intern.

The Web API is written in PHP, without any framework, and the Android app is using Volley library for communicating with the API.
